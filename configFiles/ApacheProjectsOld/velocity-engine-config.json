Any of the default properties that  aren't overridden are still in effect.  - app specified properties are first tried as a file, and then the classpath is  searched. What this means in the end is that when you want to change the configuration of some aspect of the Vel engine operation, you don't have to specify ALL of the properties, just the ones you want to change.  The rest will be the default values."
