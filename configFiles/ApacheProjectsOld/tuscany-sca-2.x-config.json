Also update to configure the domain from the context so the domain nad be customized fro the Tomcat instance and each contribution via a context parameter. That removes the need for the singleton install option so that is removed. Also update the install page to have a bit of text about whats going on in the intsall"

Hazelcast has various encryption options to secure the domain, and it has a way to have endpoints removed when a node disapears (though that requires a bit of code on our part to get to work). One limitation is currently it doesnt support multiple nodes using multicast, but they've said they can fix that."

This approach seems a little conveluted so if anyone has a better approach please do say, this one uses the Maven buildnumber plugin to set a mvn property with the svn revision, which is then written into a message properties file with the antrun plugin, which is then used initilize a constant in a Version class. Not sure if it even actually works, committing it so i can get a Hudson build and check if it does end up with the correct value"

Fixing the WSDL requires other fixes, for example, a new databinding to force ServiceReference to map to anyType (so that we don't try and process these interfaces with JAXB) and a fix to correct the order of response holders.
