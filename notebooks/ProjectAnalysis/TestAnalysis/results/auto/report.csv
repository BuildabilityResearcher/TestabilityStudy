Like AutoValue, AutoOneOf allows values to be primitive arrays, but the code template referenced an undefined variable in that case. The implementation of foo.getMyArray() copies the array, so the implementation of equals(Object) checks whether the Object is of the generated subclass, and if so accesses the private myArray field directly. For @AutoValue Foo, this subclass is AutoValue_Foo, and the $subclass template variable is set to that. But for @AutoOneOf Foo, there is a subclass per property, and we actually want AutoOneOf_Foo.Impl_myArray.
