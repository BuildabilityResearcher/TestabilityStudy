Per http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/~admin/2011/12/29/Flaw+in+ANTLR+v3+LL%28*%29+analysis+algorithm I fixed a major flaw in ANTLR's notion of context. To do that, I needed to create a new LoopEndState, with all of its fanout to the serialization and parser ATN construction. got a very good start on ParserATNPathFinder, which uses basic recursion to find all possible paths and return a tree with the possibilities. I left it in the condition where he would sometimes loop forever; it needs to track sets of configurations in the busy set; it using states at the moment.  added a new signal from the interpreter: reportAttemptingFullContext. I fixed a bug where configuration sets derived from a configuration that had reachesIntoOuterContext>0 were not being considered as dipping into the outer context. The ambiguity checker needed to switch so that a check for exact matches not suffixes when doing full context. It's faster at the very least for full context. added some more support routines to DFA.

Previously I simply rewrote the grammar and ANTLR was none the wiser. However, it quickly became apparent that ANTLR needed to do many different things for recursive rules so I had to insert transformation later in the pipeline. Specifically, I needed it after Rule object creation. I made a special LeftRecursiveRule object that track information collected during transformation so that I could use it later. I made major changes to the left recursion templates as well as the little code snippets in Java.stg.  I created a new template called LeftRecursiveRuleFunction an accompanying model object that handles the special case, even though there is some duplication. the biggest difference in the grammar is the introduction of => ID notation on any outermost alternative. This information is not added to the tree, instead the ALT node is annotated with the ID.  Rule.getAltLabels() now looks also in the LeftRecursiveRuleAltInfo objects. I have moved to the left recursion transformation to its own object and have moved some objects into the analysis package. Further, I have split out the Rule object creation into its own RuleCollector. I renamed discoverAlt in the grammar tree visitor to be discoverOuterAlt an added discoverAlt so we can get information about individual alts even inside subrules.  Listeners always get an event for the generic rule context, which is used if there is no specific label for an alternative. Added a list of iteration operations for LL(*) subrules. Split buildRuleFunction into buildLeftRecursiveRuleFunction and one for normal rule function creation. I have to insert lots of extra code to manage the contexts, but of course it's all done using the templates. As long as those templates are correct, this code generation mechanism will work.  I removed the st field from the parser rule context. I injected the left recursion transformation inside the SemanticPipeline.  Visitor dispatch methods are always added to the generated context structures. Fixed some unit tests. About 24 fail.",336,21821

ATNBuilder.g now tracks the outer alternative number and calls new factory commands on the lexer commands. Removed unnecessary resolveWithPredicate field from ATNConfig Added lexerActionIndex field to ATNConfig since we need to track whether we passed an action in an alternative will rule in the lexer. Renamed ruleIndex in DFAState and added the lexer action index so that we can execute lexer actions from the DFA. added functions to the grammar tree visitor for the lexer commands. Added templates for the lexer commands. Augmented the lexer ATN factory so that it constructs plain old actions from the lexer commands it finds. That way, the code generator doesn't know any different and generates an action. Augmented the lexer ATN simulator so that it fires a proper action index now. previously it only used the rule index, which of course doesn't work when you have more than one action in a rule. rm'd dup code from OutputModelController altered the epsilon edge removal optimization so that it could not remove actions in lexer rules. Added list of valid lexer commands in Rule.",336,22003
