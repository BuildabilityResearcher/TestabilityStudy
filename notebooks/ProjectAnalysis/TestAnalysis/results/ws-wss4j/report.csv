The processor map in WSSConfig can now be    considered as <String, String> or <String,Processor> (similarly for the action map). When    getProcessor(QName) is called, if the object in the Map is a processor it's simply returned, if    it's a String, it gets classloaded etc. This is fully backwards compatible.  - So to use a custom processor instance, you can just do e.g.:         WSSConfig cfg = WSSConfig.getNewInstance();         cfg.setProcessor(WSSecurityEngine.SIGNATURE, new wssec.MyProcessor());         final WSSecurityEngine engine = new WSSecurityEngine();         engine.setWssConfig(cfg);         engine.processSecurityHeader(....)",200,19313
