This handler is mainly used by RxJava and Kotlin coroutines and it seems it would be best to call the end handler in all case to give an opportunity to end the treatment. In RxJava it would call the complete handler and in Kotlin it would close the underlying channel (so a for-each iteration on the channel would terminate and execute the code after).,686,78731
