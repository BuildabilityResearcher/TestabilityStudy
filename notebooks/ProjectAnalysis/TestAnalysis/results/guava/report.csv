(We don't clone the tests, so we run all methods against the same target class (the last to be initialized).) Fix up newly failing tests (except for CompactIntegerListTest, for which I've filed a bug). Most are problems with the tests themselves: - Test suppressions weren't being carried over to tests of the reserialized collections. - Map values() collections were universally assumed to permit null queries. - EnumSet was asserted to fail fast on concurrent modification. - Many ConcurrentModificationException tests advanced the iterator past the end of size-zero or size-one collections. - It's not possible to create an empty collection that contains null. Empty collections don't contain anything :) - (Bi)MapGenerator.create is passed an Object[] containing Entry objects, not an Entry[]. - (Bi)MapGenerator.create is passed an Object[] containing Entry objects, not an Entry[]. - StandardImplForwardingNavigableMap.keySet() returned a SortedSet instead of a NavigableSet. - StandardImplForwardingNavigableMap implemented lastEntry and descendingSet in terms of one another (using the standard* methods). - Tests of null SortedMultiset values fail when run against a nullsFirst() comparator because the nulls are outside the submultiset ranges tested. - NavigableSets.synchronizedNavigableSet(SafeTreeSet) does not allow null queries. - Tables.transformValues().cellSet() permits remove operations. - collect/testing SmallTests needed their timeout increased. - CompactIntegerListTest didn't specify all the mutation operations it supports. A few are fixed by improvements to production code that arguably aren't strictly ""bug fixes"": - ConcurrentHashMultiset.removeAll(collectionContainingNull) threw NPE. - Maps.unmodifiableNavigableMap().subSet/headSet/tailSet returned a SortedSet instead of a NavigableSet. - NavigableMaps.unmodifiableNavigableMap().keySet() returned a SortedSet instead of a NavigableSet. - RegularContiguousSet.contains/containsAll threw NPE (which the EmptyContiguousSet equivalents did not). - WellBehavedMap.entrySet().remove(null) threw NPE instead of returning false. (The fix removes the need for Sets.transform.) A few more are real bugs: - TreeMultiset.add(null) succeeded even for comparators that do not permit null. - TreeMultiset.remove(null) failed even for comparators that permit null. - TreeMultiset iterators couldn't remove null elements. ------------- Created by MOE: http://code.google.com/p/moe-java MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=28001960",,

The problem is that the first failure lets subsequent failures proceed before it registers itself in seenExceptions. It does register itself with setException(), but we don't have full atomicity because we have two sources of truth. (This is why we have a problem only when the first failure is involved: Other failures atomically manipulate seenExceptions.) The solution is for whichever caller initializes seenExceptions to propagate it with the value from setException(). This is a little messy but hopefully not too bad.
