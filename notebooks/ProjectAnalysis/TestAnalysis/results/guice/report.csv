1910,9a83236e,FAIL,17,NO,0,NO,0,2021-02-03 14:37:09 -0800,"Fixes the way AssistedInject deals with default methods that javac generates. Gory details:   javac sometimes generates default methods for factories.   We can't proxy them directly because the return type is different, and AssistedInject cares about the return type (to know what class to inject), so we must execute the default method as-is and let java route it.   Calling the actual default method requires using MethodHandles, but if the factory isn't public the MethodHandles.lookups() that Guice constructs won't be able to see it.   Previously, we used reflection to hack the ability to use ALL_MODES in Lookups, but that's bad and triggers a reflective access warning in newer JDKs.   We now properly use findSpecial or unreflectSpecial on a user-provided Lookups.   The user only needs to provide the Lookups if the factory is non-public. If they don't, we continue to fallback to hacky methods that may stop working at any time (and we log a warning).",617,59103
