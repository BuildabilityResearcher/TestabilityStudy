The SinkJoinerPlan is a ""fake"" plan element to group multiple output sinks into one sink (the compiler assumes one root node, this is why a ""fake"" plan node is required). 	The local strategy of SinkJoinerPlan is initialized as NONE, which means that we just pass through the elements (which makes sence since we are talking about a sink) The initialization of a NONE-local strategy assumes only one input, not two. 	I replaced the LocalStrategy with BINARY_NO_OP, which is a NONE for two input. 	The compiler is now able to do its pipline breaker checks.",,
